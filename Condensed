Linux Persistence
----------------------------------------
-Cron
  /etc/crontab
  /var/spool/cron
  /etc/cron.d
-/etc/Init <- has sysV
-/etc/profile
  Open this up and look around
-/etc/environment
-/etc/inittab <- has Sysv
/etc/rc0.d/  <- This is for run level 0. Ls without 'rc0.d' for a list of available run levels
/lib/systemd/systemd   <- One of these has systemd which can have a script embedded in it
/usr/lib/systemd/system <- One of these has systemd which can have a scripy embedded in it
-Services/Processes
  /var/log/syslog
  ps -elf <- When grepping here use quotes around what you're searching
  top or htop
  systemctl --type=timer --all 
  (start | stop | status)
  CRON IS A SERVICE



Windows Persistence
------------------------------------------
-Scheduled Tasks
Look through Task Scheduler. Look through all the scheduled tasks' actions. Very well may be obfuscated. Might be GoogleUpdate. Spotify, netflix, steam, etc. Entertainment on a government laptop is not a thing.
-Registry locations(New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount('<UserName>')).Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier]).Value
Figure out the SID of the only Totally-Legit service.
-Powershell Profiles
  4 of these
  allusers/allhost
  allusers/currenthost
  currentuser/allhost
  currentuser/currenthost
  Test-Path -Path $profile.currentUsercurrentHost  <- switch in the other profiles. If a path pops up then enumerate it.

-Services/Processes
  get-process -id <pid>
  get-service
  get-ciminstance win32_service

Artifacts:
  recycle bin
  BAM
  Prefetch
  Userassist
  A registry key could have an artifact

Bad Ports:
  1234
  4444
  5555
  5678
  8888
  9876


Good Port Examples:
  3389
  13579

Sysinternals - net use * http://live.sysinternals.com    <- throws the sysinternals tools on your system:
  Autoruns - 
    Pink means no digital signature OR no publisher info found. It frequently means bad. Use this to check scheduled tasks. Also click through the actions associated with things in the logon tab. 
    Misspelling words is wild. Everything should run out of C:\windows\system32 NOT DOWNLOADS, USERS, PUBLIC, ETC.
    File explorer may have malicious stuff in there
    Internet explorer may be useful
    Services may be useful
    Dlls, boot execute, and codex are useless

Shit that happens at the end of the windows boot process specifically for the user 'environment and profiles'

OSI
Layer          PDU
----------------------------
Application  | Data
Presentation | Data
Session      | Data
Transport    | Segment/Datagram
Network      | Packet
Data Link    | Frame
Physical     | Bit

-----------------------
MAC Address Types:

Unicast- one to one
8th bit is off

Multicast- one to many
8th bit is on

Broadcast- one to all
All 8 bits are on
------------------------
Cisco Modes:
Server
Client
Transparent - Be on the Trunking VLAN but pretend I aint here

DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)
Should be disconfigured
Automatically uodates what trunks are allowed

Discovery Protocls
______
CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
FDP (Foundation Discovery Protocol)
LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
----------------------------
Tells a network the fastest way to get to the default gateway. If a device has not been used yet it will not be apart of the 'tree'. The time it takes for all device to end up on the tree is called convergence.
Root decision process
1-Elect Root Bridge
2-Identify the Root ports on non-bridge
3-Identift the Designated port for each segment
4-Set alternate ports to blocking state


Layer 2 Attack Mitigation Tehcniques
----------------------------------------
Shutdown Unused ports
Enable Port Security
Enable Port Security 
IP Source Guard
Manaully assign STOP Root
BPDU Guard

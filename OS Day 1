Powershell? The OS?
----------------
In powershell everything is an object
Get-Process | Get-Member gets the methods of whatever process
Get-Date <- gets the date
<cmdlet>.datetime
(cmdlet).property Gives you the properties of the cmdlet
(get-process).name simplifies every process running down to just its name
$_ <- this is the last object from the pipeline
$? <- If the last command executes it is true, if it did not run then it is false.
ARRAYS: $A = 22, 5, 18, 44,  
        $B = 1..5  <- This equals every number between 1 and 5 including those two numbers.
start-process <processname>
stop-process -name <processname>
Get-Process | Get-Member | Where-Object {$_.Membertype -match ""Method}

Remove-Item <doesnt exist> -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue  <- If you try to delete an item then this will make it not say an error message
Remove-Item <exists> -verbose <- Confirms with a success message that something happened

You might find some executables or binaries in these:
HKCU - Basically just a subkey of HKU, the one for the currently logged in user - Symbolic link <- Just go to HKU unless it tells you to look specifically at the curently logged in user
HKU - Users - has a subkey for each user on the computer
  User Env settings
  Shortcuts
  File associations
HKLM - Whole computer. 
  HARDWARE
  SAM
  Security - asscessed via lsass.exe
  System
HKCC - Current Config - a symbolic link to the coniguration from HKLM
HKCR - Classes Root - references HKLM

SID 1232432314-15154235243-1002
                          ------ Only the 1002 matters

various registry commands:
reg query
reg add
reg delete

For finding a subkey use gci <Reg entry>
For find a value use Get-item <Reg entry>

net use * http://live.sysinternals.com <- creates a network share to sysinternals
Type *autoruns -accepteula* <- Throw this into autoruns or it wont work
Get -PSDrive gets the current PSDrive

Find the description for a service:
Get-CimInstance Win32_Service -Filter 'Name = "LegoLand"' | Format-List Name, Description

Get word count for a text document
get-content words2.txt | Measure-object -word 

Find the number of files in a directory
(gci videos).count

Compare two different text files to see what is different
compare-object (get-content old.txt) (get-content new.txt) | out-file C:\Users\CTF\Downloads\compare.txt

Check a directory for alternate data streams and read it
gci -recurse | % { gi $_.FullName -stream * } | where stream -ne ':$Data'
get-content <insert PSChildname>

Get-content but for all the hidden files in a directory
gci -recurse C:\Users\Ctf -attribute h | get-content

Shows the groups respective permissions for a file
get-acl -path C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts | select-object -ExpandProperty Access | Where-objec
t {$_.FileSystemRights -like "*Read*"}

UAC Registry Keys:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System

Linux Essentials:
arp - shows mac addrs of devices on network
route - shows where packets will be routed
--help
man - manual for a command
dont cat /bin or /sbin it dont work
etc has network configurations, daemons, firewall configurations, etc.
/etc/group contains what groups each user is apart of
Permissions. U G O user/owner  group   other
U   G   O
rwx rwx rwx
Sticky Bit - The only person who can delte a file with the sticky bit is the owner and root
s in UGO Means they can run it with the same permissions as the owner
awk seperates uses delimeters and can format
sed is similar to awk

Linux Boot Process:
1st stage bootloader
MBR
bootstrap code area 446 bytes
Partition entry 1    16 bytes
2		     16 bytes
3                    16 bytes
4                    16 bytes
boot signature		    16

/dev/vda has the contents of the MBR
dd if=/dev/vda of=MBRcopy bs=512 count=1 <- Making a copy of the MBR <- This will probably fail
sudo !!                   -- <- Block size

sudo xxd -1 512 -g 1 /dev/vda <- examining the contents of MBR

UEFI uses GPT which supports an ungodly amount of paritions
Linnux uses system calls

/etc/init is the configuration file for the init process, there can definetly be PERSISTENCE HERE It tells you what level your system will be running on
Cat the levels themselves. S levels will be where persistence is.

for systemd the init process configuration file is /usr/lib/systemd/system
READ ABOUT SYSTEMD

/etc/environment can mess with the path variable which means there could be persistence here
/etc/profile is a script that loads whenever a user logs in with an interactive shell. THIS CAN HAVE PERSISTENCE
.bash/profile and .bashrc could have persistence as they run during logon. 


Process validity Linux: 
top is live processes in linux
ps -elf to show processes
htop is top but human readable
S, PID, PPID, CMD <- important parts of ps -elf
kthreadd is a kernel process, dont worry about it
/sbin/init processes have a PID of 1 <- worry about it

Ring 0 kernel
EUID -effective
RUID - real
UID  - user

fork creates a new process which is refered to as a chld process
exec runs a process

kill -9 PID 
pkill -i PNAME

ps --ppid 1 <- shows orphans that could be malware posing as a daemon

exceute on a folder means you can change directories to it

/proc/directory has a file for every process 


All of these could have persistence

Day 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
session 0 is Kernel
session 1 is user

UEFI is BIOS but newer

Once the BIOS checks hardware, it finds the MBR (Master Boot Record). The MBR contains Disk Partitions like /dev/sda1 or DISK 1 C:\
Get-Content C:\Windows\Panther\Setupact.log | Select-String "Detected boot environment"  <- command to find if your system is BIOS or UEFI

smss is part of the startup process and splits into session 0 and session 1. Session 0 is kernel layer and can do system level stuff, session 1 is for the user..
bcdedit shows the boot loader
bcdedit /set <value>
bcdedit /deletevalue <value>

Gets modules for chrome ->Get-Process chrome | foreach {$_.modules} | more
SCHEDULED TASKS ARE A GOOD PLACE FOR PERSISTENCE.

Process lists have:
mispelled names: scvhost vs svchost
Incorrect directories: Program Files runs third party things, system runs system things, downloads runs things from the internet which can be bad to go
Incorrect ports: HTTP runs on 80 or 8080
Important processes should only pop up once
System processes should have low PIDs
DLLs are cool, just not on the test

strings -a C:\users\andy.dwyer\Desktop\<doc>.txt <- use this to look through binaries texts
^ - strings requires eulaaccept
get sysinternals

sysinternals has:
TCPView - Shows details about connections
Closed, Listen, Syn Sent, Syn Recieved, Established, Fin wait 1, Fin wait 2, Close Wait, Closing, Ack, Time Wait, Delete TCB 
AutoRuns - shows registry things running
